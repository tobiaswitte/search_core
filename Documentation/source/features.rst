configuration needs. Still it's possible to configure the indexer.

Also custom classes can be used as indexers.

Furthermore a finisher for TYPO3 Form-Extension is provided to integrate indexing.

.. _features_search:

Searching

Currently all fields are searched for a single search input.

Also multiple filter are supported. Filtering results by fields for string contents.

Facets / aggregates are also possible. Therefore a mapping has to be defined in TypoScript for
indexing, and the facets itself while searching.
